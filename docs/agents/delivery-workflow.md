# Delivery workflow

This repository uses the classic planning and delivery sequence from the engineering skills.
`to-spec` is the current name of the former `to-prd` skill.

## Canonical sequence

For a large effort whose route is still unclear:

```text
Wayfinder → to-spec → to-tickets → /ready
```

1. **Wayfinder** resolves product, research, prototype, and prerequisite decisions until the map is clear.
2. **to-spec** collapses the cleared map into one implementation-ready spec issue.
3. **to-tickets** turns the accepted spec into approved tracer-bullet implementation tickets with native blocking edges.
4. **/ready** selects and claims one frontier ticket, executes it directly in the current session, runs focused and final validation, self-reviews the diff, commits to the current branch, and closes the exact ticket automatically.

Run `to-spec` and `to-tickets` in the same context window when practical so a large spec does not need to be fetched again.

## Stage boundaries

### Wayfinder: decisions only

A Wayfinder map is complete when no in-scope decision remains open and no in-scope fog remains.
Its children are decision tickets:

- `wayfinder:research` establishes an external fact or recommendation;
- `wayfinder:grilling` resolves a product decision with the owner;
- `wayfinder:prototype` creates disposable evidence for a specific unresolved design question;
- `wayfinder:task` performs prerequisite work needed to make a decision.

A `wayfinder:task` does not implement the destination. Production code, integration, E2E delivery, and regression repair belong downstream.

Wayfinder maps in this repository are planning-only. Do not add an execution override to a map's Notes. Do not apply `wayfinder:*` labels to implementation tickets.

### to-spec: one buildable source

When a Wayfinder map clears, invoke `to-spec` on the map issue, not on an individual decision ticket. The spec gathers the distributed decisions, user stories, implementation decisions, test seams, and out-of-scope boundary into one parent issue.

For a settled change that spans several sessions but never needed Wayfinder, start directly at `to-spec`.

### to-tickets: implementation backlog

Invoke `to-tickets` only after the spec is accepted. Review and approve the proposed granularity and blockers before publication. Each published ticket must be a complete, independently verifiable vertical slice sized for one fresh context window.

Implementation tickets reference the spec as their parent. They are not children of the Wayfinder map and do not carry `wayfinder:*` labels. Native blockers define the frontier. Once child tickets are published, remove `ready-for-agent` from the parent spec if an automated runner might otherwise implement the entire spec directly.

### /ready: one ticket per session

Invoke `/ready` and select one unblocked implementation ticket in a fresh session. Ready consumes accepted decisions and executes the ticket directly; it does not reopen product discovery or reslice the backlog. If the ticket is too large for one context window, leave it open and return it to `to-tickets` for a smaller vertical breakdown.

Ready works on the current branch. In this repository that is `main` unless the user explicitly requests a branch. It owns claim, focused implementation, tests, final validation, self-review, exact-reference commit, and fail-closed automatic issue closure without an intermediate execution command.

## Short paths

- **Small and already decided:** execute directly in the current session; skip Wayfinder, spec, and tickets.
- **Decided but multi-session:** `to-spec → to-tickets → /ready`.
- **Large with unresolved fog:** `Wayfinder → to-spec → to-tickets → /ready`.
- **Incoming external issue:** use `triage`; it joins the agent-ready frontier and is selected through `/ready`.

One artifact owns each stage. Never let a Wayfinder map and `to-tickets` create competing implementation backlogs for the same scope.
